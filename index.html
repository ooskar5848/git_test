       <h1> An old japanese proverb</h1>
       
        <p><em>The japanese</em> say we have <strong>three faces</strong>.
         The <strong>first face</strong>, we show to the world.
          The <strong>second face</strong>, we only show to close friends 
          and family. And our <strong>third face</strong> is shown only 
          to ourselves. </p>
<h3>Which face do you show?</h3>
 <!Did h3 need Paragraph indentation?!>
       <P>The first face is the least true representation of who we really are. 
           The third face is the most representative of our true
           being. The second is somewhere in between. Do you
           show your first face constantly, even to the ones
           you are close with? Or maybe you show your second face to the world.
           Regardless, no one ever shows their third face.</P>
